# nanojit OpCodes

In Nanojit, LIR is the source language for compilation to machine code. LIR stands for low-level intermediate representation.  It is a typed assembly language.
The LIR instruction set is best learnt by reading nanojit/LIRopcode.tbl.  Code for manipulating LIR is in nanojit/LIR.h.

# LIR OpCodes

Opcodes use type-indicators suffixes that are loosely based on C type names:

* - 'c': "char",  ie. 8-bit integer
* - 's': "short", ie. 16-bit integer
* - 'i': "int",   ie. 32-bit integer
* - 'q': "quad",  ie. 64-bit integer
* - 'u': "unsigned", is used as a prefix on integer type-indicators when necessary
* - 'f': "float",   ie. 32-bit floating point value
* -'f4': "float4",  ie. 128-bit SIMD value containing 4 single-precision floating point values
* - 'd': "double",  ie. 64-bit floating point value
* - 'p': "pointer", ie. an int on 32-bit machines, a quad on 64-bit machines

'p' opcodes are all aliases of int and quad opcodes, they're given in LIR.h
and chosen according to the platform pointer size.

Certain opcodes aren't supported on all platforms

## Branches and labels

'jt' and 'jf' must be adjacent so that (op ^ 1) gives the opposite one.
Static assertions in LIR.h check this requirement.

| Opcode | Todo | Return Type | Featured | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| j|         Op2|   V|     |  jump always |
| jt|        Op2|   V|     |  jump if true |
| jf|        Op2|   V|     |  jump if false |
| jtbl|      Jtbl|  V|     |  jump to address in table |
| label|     Op0|   V|     |  a jump target (no machine code is emitted for this) |

## Guards
'xt' and 'xf' must be adjacent so that (op ^ 1) gives the opposite one.
Static assertions in LIR.h check this requirement.

OP_UN (align_guards)

| Opcode | Todo | Return Type | Featured | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x|         Op2|   V|     |  exit always |
| xt|        Op2|   V|     | exit if true |
| xf|        Op2|   V|     | exit if false |
| xbarrier|  Op2|   V|     | A LIR_xbarrier cause no code to be generated, but it acts like a never-taken guard in that it inhibits certain optimisations, such as dead stack store elimination. |

## Immediates

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| immi|      IorF|  I|     | int immediate |
|immq|      QorD|  Q| 64-bit    | quad immediate |

| immf|      IorF|  F|     | float immediate |
| immf4|     F4|    F4|    | float4 immediate |

## Comparisons

All comparisons return an int:  0 on failure and 1 on success.
Within each type group, order must be preserved so that, except for eq*, (op
^ 1) gives the opposite one (eg. lt ^ 1 == gt).  eq* must have odd numbers
for this to work.  They must also remain contiguous so that opcode range
checking works correctly.  Static assertions in LIR.h check these
requirements.

The result is always used as the second operand of a LIR_ii2d. |
